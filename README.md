# Dice Roll Game Assignment
## Overview
The rules of this game are simple. First, the program rolls a six-sided dice, generating a random number between 1 and 6, kept hidden from the user. The user then has 3 tries to guess what number was on the die.
## An exercise in OOP
This particular assignment demonstrates the use of classes being dedicated to Single Responsibilities in terms of business decisions. Classes have been separated into two different namespaces - one for game logic which contains three classes, and another for the user interface which contains a class to govern the user input and parsing.
## Further Refinement
This exercise will be revisited when carrying out the chapter on unit testing, but could also use some further error handling when users guess outside the range of the dice.
